# Changelog

All notable changes to pdf-toolkit, newest first. **One entry per implemented spec,
written by that spec's own commit** — never batched, never back-filled, never edited
afterwards (a correction is a new entry).

Entry format: `## [PDF-NN] <Spec title> — <YYYY-MM-DD>`, then 1–5 bullets.
New entries are inserted **directly below the anchor line**, above the previous newest entry.

Three rules bind every entry:

1. **Append at the top, at the anchor.** Never at the bottom, and never inside another
   entry.
2. **Each spec's own commit writes its own entry**, so `git show <sha> -- changelog.md`
   proves the entry and the code landed together.
3. **Never edit a landed entry.** A correction is a new entry with a new date.

Audit this file per commit with `git show <sha> -- changelog.md`, never with a heading
grep at `HEAD` — a grep at `HEAD` is exactly what hides a lost prepend.

<!-- CHANGELOG-ANCHOR: insert new entries directly below this line, newest first -->
